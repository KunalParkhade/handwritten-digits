# MNIST Classification
<br>![pr_vs_recall](https://github.com/KunalParkhade/mnist_class/blob/main/images/precision_vs_recall_plot.png)


This repository contains code and resources for classifying the MNIST dataset, which is often considered the "Hello World" of machine learning. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels.

## Contents

- `MNIST.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading, training, and evaluating a machine learning model on the MNIST dataset, including exploration of precision/recall tradeoff, F1 score, and other evaluation metrics.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist_class.git
    cd mnist_class
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook MNIST.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Repository Structure

- `MNIST.ipynb`: Main notebook with the following sections:
    - Data loading and preprocessing
    - Model definition
    - Model training
    - Model evaluation, including precision/recall tradeoff, F1 score, and other metrics
    - Visualization of results
